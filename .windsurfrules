Project Architecture Rules

State Management
- Use Redux Toolkit for all client-side state
- Every new feature must live under `src/features/<featureName>/`

Feature Structure
- For each feature, create:
  - `<featureName>Slice.ts`
  - `<featureName>Thunk.ts`
- Do not place slices or thunks outside the feature folder

Thunks & API
- All async logic must live in thunks
- Thunks must use the shared `@apiService.ts`
- Do not call APIs directly inside components

Store Registration
- Every new slice must be registered in the central Redux store
- Export selectors from the slice file when applicable

Coding Conventions
- Use TypeScript strictly (no `any`)
- Use named exports
- Follow existing folder and naming conventions
